## How to Use

You can use a lot of JavaIME features in the following ways.


### Example
#### Import
> Note you can also press ENTER rather than TAB

To import the *java.utils.Collections package*, type **COLLECTIONS** in *(uppercase)*. Suggestions should already be popping up then press *TAB* to select. The package will be automatically imported.

#### Auto-Complete listener interfaces
To show a listener interface completion, type **L-** followed by the listener interface name. e.g.
	
**L-Focus** TAB should show 

```
	FocusListener
```

#### Class Instance
Type **I-class name** e.g. **I-Scanner** should show
```python
	Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

```
#### Listener Events
Type **E-** followed by event and press tab. e.g.
	**E-act** then press TAB should show

```python
	public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e){
	 // contents 
	}
```

#### Try Catch
You can also press **try** then TAB to get
```python
	try {
		
	}

	catch (Exception err) {
		System.out.println(err.getMessage());
	}
```

#### Methods
Methods pop up by default so you can just press TAB or ENTER.

#### Static methods
Type **S-** followed by method name. e.g.
Type **S-AR**  then TAB to get

	ARGV
